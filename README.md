# Feed Reader Testing

This project is part of Udacity nanodegree program (for Frontend web developers). The code given by Udacity was edited by me, Karolina Seidlova. Its aim is to familiarize with Jasmine testing.

## What is tested?
File feedreader.js contains four test suites:
1. RSS Feeds 
	- if feeds are defined
	- have defined URLs and names 
	- URLs and names are not empty
2. The menu 
	- if it's hidden by default
	- if the visibility changes when the menu icon is clicked
3. Initial Entries 
	- if at least one entry exists
4. New Feed Selection 
	- if the feed changes when new feed is selected and loaded

## How to run the test?
Open index.html to run the test, it may takes some time to load the page and finish all tests. Result of Jasmine testing can be found in the bottom of the page.
